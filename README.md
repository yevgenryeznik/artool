<b><em>A</em></b>daptive <b><em>R</em></b>andomization ***tool*** for clinical trials.

The aim of the package is modelling and simulations of clinical trials with different randomiztion techniques such as

- Restricted Randomization (***RR***)
- Response-Adaptive Randomization (***RAR***)
- Covariate-Adaptive Randomization (***CA***)
- Covariate-Adjusted Response-Adaptive Randomization (***CARA***)

So far, several RR procedures have been implemented.

E = mc^2
